# 🧠 My Process 
Step-by-step of how I setup this project. This project is optimized for scalability, meaning it can be used to simulate as many machines as you want. Feel free to make small changes if you want.


# 🕹️ Setting up the Domain Controller
1. Open up Oracle Virtualbox Manager and press new.  
	1. Give your VM a name, and select the .iso file for your server.<br /> <img width="622" height="249" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46b5d876-d0a0-4bf4-ae34-cf7b15713f3b" />
   1. Click on `specify virtual hardware`, and drag the Base Memory to at least 7000mg (7gbs), and select at least 2 CPUs.<br /> *should look something like this* <br /> <img width="620" height="104" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7edd9410-3e6e-4564-b66a-41229f86eaa9" /> 
    1. Also make sure that you have enough storage, I put 40gbs. <br /> <img width="604" height="201" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e14b1eaa-9885-460f-9adb-3b0cb745dbc6" />

   1. Select `Windows Server 2022 Standard Evaluation (Desktop Experience)`
