# 🖳 Self-hosted-Windows-11-Server-2022-Project (in progress)
*This project was dedicated to practicing Active Directory, Intune, Jira Service Management (My ticketing system, and joining a machine to a domain controller.  
I utilized the level 2 hypervisor Virtual Box to host multiple virtual machines, with one being used to host the Windows server, and the other as a Windows user,  
mirroring a workplace enviroment that allowed me to simulate help-desk/technical-support tasks and ticket management.*

# ⌨️ How to replicate this project!
  -**Choose a level 2 hypervisor**: An example would be VMware, but I chose Oracle Virtual Box because its *free*,  
  but also because it's very easy to use, and a good platform to start learning about *virtualization!*
  
  -**Grab your .iso files**: Both Windows 11, and Windows 11 Server 2022 are completely free to grab online, and will  
  be listed at the bottom in the downloads section of this repo.
  
  -**Run both .iso files as independent virtual machines
