Follow this series by Kevtech IT Support (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdh13bXVc6-nhNqrV6pNQFsBXtUxm5hiK), you could also just follow along with my steps in the **My Process** section of this repo.    
For ticket management use Jira Service Management (**FREE!!!**), and make sure to allocate at least 6-8gbs of ram to each VM (I learned the hard way)
